The first essay-------------------------[推荐一本你最喜欢的小说]
	As for as I am concerned, Journey to the West is superior to any other
book I have ever read.Actually ,it is a very famous romantic myth novel in
China ,It was adapted for television in 1986,and since then,this book has

my attention.Thanks to this book,I have learned that perseverance[不屈不挠]
is the key to success.Last but not least,the structure of the novel is
excellent .The whole novel is presented to readers thought a series of 
independent but coherent stories.

Chinese literature

The second essay------------------------[谈论一下你的理想校园是什么样的]
	Campus is where students study.Different,studentd long for[渴望] different 
kinds of campuses,Some prefer a big campus with grand[豪华的] buildings while others
are fond[喜欢的] of a campus with a large playground. I have my own dream about an 
ideal campus.
	In my opinion,an ideal campus should have the following characteristics[特征].
Firstly,a modern library with an abundant[丰富的] collection of books is a must for 
my ideal campus.Books are the main sources of knowledge, and numerous[众多的] books
can offer rich knowledge to students,Secondly,sports facilities[设备] mean a lot to 
me,as I pay equal attention to[注意力] both academic achievement and physical health.
If you want to put what you have learned from books into practice,good health
is essential.It is not rare that many famous universities pay great attention
to sports .Last but not least,highly qualified[有资格的] teachers are the core[核心]
competitiveness of universities.A great teacher is one of the most important

The thrid essay ------------------------<<在你生命中最什么是最宝贵>>
	What is the most valueable thing in life?Different people hold different opinions.
Some value treasure beauty.However,I do belive in the saying ,"Frendship is one of life's
greatest treasures".So,I cherish friends most.
	People always say that a life without a life without a sun.My opinion coincides with 
this idea.Man is a social animal.We find fulfillment in association with others,especially
those who share the common interests with us.Besides,all of us,at certain moments of our lives,
need to take advice and receive help from other people.A good friend is like a mirror.
It shows not only shining points but also you shortcomings so to help you become a better persion.
	Of course,another saying goes that  a friend in need is a friend indeed.Those who share only
the happy moments are not the friends that I have in my mind,and those who are willing to share 
both happiness and hardship are true friends we should treasure.
