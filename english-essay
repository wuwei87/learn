The first essay-------------------------[推荐一本你最喜欢的小说]
	As for as I am concerned, Journey to the West is superior to any other
book I have ever read.Actually ,it is a very famous romantic myth novel in
China ,It was adapted for television in 1986,and since then,this book has

	There were reasons for my perference for Journey to the West,Firstly,
there are many wonderful stories in the book which made gread impression
on me.In addition,the contents and the meaning it conveys also attract
my attention.Thanks to this book,I have learned that perseverance[不屈不挠]
is the key to success.Last but not least,the structure of the novel is
excellent .The whole novel is presented to readers thought a series of 
independent but coherent stories.

Chinese literature

	Campus is where students study.Different,studentd long for[渴望] different 
kinds of campuses,Some prefer a big campus with grand[豪华的] buildings while others
are fond[喜欢的] of a campus with a large playground. I have my own dream about an 
ideal campus.
	In my opinion,an ideal campus should have the following characteristics[特征].
Firstly,a modern library with an abundant[丰富的] collection of books is a must for 
my ideal campus.Books are the main sources of knowledge, and numerous[众多的] books
can offer rich knowledge to students,Secondly,sports facilities[设备] mean a lot to 
me,as I pay equal attention to[注意力] both academic achievement and physical health.
If you want to put what you have learned from books into practice,good health
is essential.It is not rare that many famous universities pay great attention
to sports .Last but not least,highly qualified[有资格的] teachers are the core[核心]
competitiveness of universities.A great teacher is one of the most important
assest[优点]for an excellent university.
